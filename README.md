# authentech

Built by Victor Verma, Josh Leeds, Thomas Yousef, and Rohan Kumar for KTPHackathon 2024. The theme is student life tech, and our problem to solve was the unverifiable nature of college applications. For example, it is possible to fabricate extracurriculars when applying to college via the Common App. Our solution was to create a platform to act as the intermediary between accredited high schools and organizations and universities, such that a university can verify that each applicant has verified ECs, clubs, and volunteering.
